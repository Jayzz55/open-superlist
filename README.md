## Superlist: A self-destructing to-do list to keep you focused on the things that really matter.

Created by : Jaya Wijono [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

<!-- ***Use case***

To-do lists are notorious for collecting junk: to-do items that you want to remember, but are not very important and thus get consistently put-off. To address the problem of to-do list clutter, we'll create an application that we'll call Blocitoff. Blocitoff will aim to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after 7 days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in 7 days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list. -->
